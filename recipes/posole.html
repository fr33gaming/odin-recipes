        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 onion chopped</li>

        <li>1 pound boneless pork loin, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>

        <li>1 (29 ounce) can yellow hominy, drained</li>
        <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups of water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chili powder</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Place the peppers with cut sides down onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Cook under the preheated broiler until the skin of the peppers has blackened and blistered, 5 to 8 minutes. Place the blackened peppers into a bowl and tightly seal 
            with plastic wrap. Allow the peppers to steam as they cool, about 20 minutes. Remove plastic wrap and carefully remove and discard pepper skins. Dice peppers.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender and fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir pork into onion and garlic; cook and stir until pork is browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Add diced green chiles to pork; cook and stir until fragrant, 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour white hominy, yellow hominy, chicken broth, water, cumin, chili powder, salt, and black pepper into pork mixture. Bring mixture to a boil and cook for 15 
            minutes; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until flavors blend and pork is tender, at least 1 hour.</li>
    </ol>
